# Installation

[Download the .aar file](https://github.com/Brudigem/DropDownWarning/raw/master/dropdownwarninglibrary-release.aar)

Go to *File* -> *New* -> *New Module* -> *Import .Jar/.AAR Package*

Add this to your dependecies
```
dependecies{
    compile project (":dropdownwarninglibrary-release")
}

```

Or simply include 
```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
in your project gradle and then:
```
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.Norbert515:DropDownWarning:-SNAPSHOT'
	}
```

# Code


First you need the top level Layout (most of the times it's a relative layout), you will need to give it an id in the XML.

```
RelativeLayout rootView = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.rootView);
```
Next you need to create a DropDownWarning.Builder

###Builder
```
DropDownWarning dropDownWarning = new DropDownWarning.Builder(Context context, ViewGroup parent)

    .interpolatorIn(Interpolator interpolator) //Intepolator used for the "show" animation
    
    .interpolatorOut(Interpolator interpolator) //Interpolator used for the "hide" animation
    
    .animationLength(int length) //Lenght of the animation in ms
    
    .textHeight(int height) //Height of the text view
    
    .message(String message) //Message to display
    
    .foregroundColor(int color) //Color of the text in argb
    
    .backgroundColor(int color) //Color of the background in argb
    
    .build() //return DropDownWarning
```


To display the warning you need to call:
```
dropDownWarning.show()
```
and to hide it:
```
dropDownWarning.hide()
```
